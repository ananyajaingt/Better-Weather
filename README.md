# Better-Weather
HackGT 2022

Your one stop platform to know how you should dress, what you should carry, and what to expect from the weather today!
You can check the weather on any day you want 2 weeks from now!

For HackGT, our MVP is the Python Code since we dont have the manpower to build an app. 
- The Python code runs on an external API Visual Crossing. 
- It extrats data of the weather on the date the user wants.
- Based on the temperature, wind, sun radiation statistics creates a checklist of things required for the day.

Plan for the App:
- Eventually the user can enter their schedule and the app will send notifications 15 mins before the user leaves the home.
- This will be a checklist that desceribes what all are the essentials that must be carried for the day, like a sweater, an umbrella.
